# 🔐 Security Risk Assessment: Preventing Data Breaches in a Social Media Organization

This project outlines a **security risk assessment** conducted after a **data breach** that exposed customer personal information at a social media company. The assessment identifies **major vulnerabilities** and presents **practical hardening tools and methods** to enhance the organization’s network defenses.

## 📘 Scenario Overview

🧑‍💻 You are a **security analyst** working for a social media organization. The company recently experienced a **major data breach**, compromising customers’ personal information, including names and addresses.

🔍 After inspecting the network, you discovered **four major vulnerabilities**:

1. ❌ Employees **share passwords**  
2. ❌ The **admin password** for the database is set to the **default**  
3. ❌ Firewalls **do not filter** incoming/outgoing traffic  
4. ❌ **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** is **not used**

⚠️ If no action is taken, the organization remains at **high risk** of future breaches.

---

## 🛠️ Selected Hardening Tools and Methods

Here are **three security hardening tools and practices** to mitigate the vulnerabilities:

### 🔑 1. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA requires users to verify their identity using **two or more methods** before accessing systems.  
✅ Examples: Fingerprint scans, ID cards, PINs, passwords

---

### 🔐 2. Setting and Enforcing Strong Password Policies
Improve password security by:
- Requiring longer, complex passwords 🔡
- Prohibiting password sharing 🙅
- Locking accounts after multiple failed attempts 🚫

---

### 🔥 3. Performing Regular Firewall Maintenance
Ensure firewalls are:
- Properly configured 🧱
- Routinely updated to block emerging threats 🛡️
- Reviewed after security events for continuous protection 🔍

---

## 📋 Security Recommendations

✅ **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
Adds an extra layer of defense and discourages password sharing.

✅ **Strong Password Policies**  
Require complex passwords, regular updates, and restrict reuse.

✅ **Firewall Rule Maintenance**  
Filters suspicious traffic and helps prevent attacks like DoS/DDoS.

---

## 🎯 Outcome

By implementing these measures, the organization can:
- Minimize the risk of **unauthorized access**
- Protect **customer data**
- Meet **industry security standards and compliance requirements**

## 🚨 Important Note

🧪 This project is a **simulated cybersecurity training exercise from Google Cybersecurity Certificate**  
💡 No real customer data or production systems were used or compromised.
